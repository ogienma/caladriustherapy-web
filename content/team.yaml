      <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about helping individuals navigate life’s complexities with clarity, ease, and resilience. By embracing holistic wellness principles, I strive to foster a safe and inclusive environment for clients of diverse backgrounds. Within my therapy practice, my primary goal is to cultivate a safe and nurturing environment where clients feel empowered to explore their innermost thoughts and emotions. It’s in this space of comfort and vulnerability that we can go into the core issues, asking and answering the tough questions that lead to meaningful breakthroughs. I firmly believe in collaboration, working hand in hand with clients to navigate this journey of self-discovery and facilitate lasting transformation. Working together, we embark on a profound journey to uncover your truest self, laying the groundwork for genuine and lasting change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pull from an eclectic approach, which includes Person-Centered, Mindfulness, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Solution-Focused Therapy, and more. I tailor each session to meet your unique needs and cultural perspectives, honoring your beliefs, values, and norms during our sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of counseling, I’m all about watching movies and TV shows, cooking and trying new foods with family and friends (which includes drinking lots of coffee) and loving on my fur babies. I’m also big on practicing self-care and incorporating a form of movement for my body, such as hitting the gym, trying new yoga classes, or hanging outside and going on a walk with my favorite people.

      It is my greatest honor to walk alongside people who have decided to do the work. Therapy isn’t a magic wand. It will take some time and at least a few (or more than a few…) missteps. My job is to get you to a place where you have the self-awareness, support system, strategies and knowledge to manage life without me. Yes, my goal is to work myself out of a job! Until then, I will foster a space that invites trust, vulnerability, honest feedback for each other, and some laughs here and there.

        Progress in life is a process. To move forward, sometimes you have
        to look back to see how much progress you have made, but you must
        also look ahead to see how much more progress remains. This
        process doesn’t come without bumps and bruises. It can produce
        feelings of anxiety, anger, or depression, and sometimes we may
        lose loved ones or damage relationships while on our journey.

        No matter where you are on your journey, I am here to help you
        process those traumatic experiences, those sleepless nights that
        keep you up, and the moments that prevent you from being present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progress awaits you with open arms. Trust and give yourself grace
        along the way. Therapy can be scary. Perhaps this isn’t your first
        time attending therapy. Or maybe, therapy is not common in your
        community and you never even considered it.

        We all deserve the feeling of being present, inspired, and happy.

        find clarity and embrace your authentic self.I will provide a
        person-centered approach that meets you where you are and allows

      <p>
        My beliefs are greatly influenced by the philosophy that all people are capable of change and growth, and deserve to feel joy in this world. My primary theoretical orientation is grounded in the post-modern, Narrative Therapy approach, which examines the rich experiences of my life and the way I share my story with others and reflectively view it myself. In the words of Anderson and Goolishian, "it is my responsibility as a therapist to cultivate a growing awareness of the dominant (and potentially dominating) stories in our society and to develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when I sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the people who consult with me."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have used much of my teachings of yoga to ground my work with mindfulness, which is proven to help people live more fully and presently, engaged in connecting with themselves and others. I utilize polyvagal theory and somatic experience when working with clients to regulate their nervous systems and communicate their needs in various environments and relationships. I have found this to be particularly powerful when working in the intersections of trauma, neurodivergence, and gender diversity. I have found a passion in serving folks in the queer community, seeking affirming and safe relationships. I provide support to those looking to embrace their authentic selves and loved ones by writing letters for gender-affirming treatment, attuning to unique needs and experiences, and holding an accepting and non-judgmental space to process pain and pleasure. I also have a passion for working with families to promote understanding and compassion for gender-expansive children and have specialized training in providing child-led gender-affirming play therapy.    
      </p>
      <p>
       I continue to follow my love for providing mental health care to individuals who seek to learn and embrace themselves and their relationships. I’m working towards a certification in sex therapy, specializing in queer and kink-affirming relationships, relationships with partners who have experienced sexual and incestual trauma, and individuals with medical barriers to sexual fulfillment. I have Level 1 & 2 Gottman Method Couples Therapy training and practice in using Emotion Focused Therapy to empirically support and guide relational work with couples and families who may seek healing, understanding, or pre-commitment work. I am currently participating in an 18-month sex therapy certification program at the Modern Sex Therapy Institute and am a member of the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists. I specialize in working with partners or individuals who struggle with compulsive sexual behaviors, porn addiction, and betrayal trauma. I will help you hold onto hope and healing by guiding you to safely confront feelings of shame, align with integrity to your values and beliefs, and rebuild intimacy with yourself and in your relationships.

        I chose a career in mental health because I understand that humans are hardwired for connection but life can sometimes leave us feeling disconnected. I chose to go into clinical social work to help people through suffering, to help people reconnect with themselves and the people that matter most to them, and to help people make the positive changes they need to live the life that is most fulfilling for them. I am most passionate about helping people make connections about their past experiences/upbringing to increase their self-awareness and cultivate self-compassion for the struggles they are facing in the present moment. Giving people a place to process whatever they need to process, without any fear of judgment, where they feel understood, accepted, valued, and safe. Empowering people to take action to get their wants and needs met in their relationships (romantic, platonic, and familial). I strive to empower and support all clients to make the changes necessary for them to meet their goals through the cultivation of understanding, awareness, and self-compassion.

    bio:
      <p>
        Tackling all that may be thrown your way can be incredibly
        difficult, especially if you take on the challenge alone. My goal
        is to support and hold space for you on that journey. If you are
        experiencing anxiety, grief, or life transitions, I will stand
        beside you as we work to process the impact of those stressors on
        your day to day life. I am here to provide encouragement and space
        to verbalize your frustrations while offering helpful coping
        skills, increased insight, and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am especially passionate about working with women who are
        struggling to protect and maintain their mental health. There are
        times where we feel silenced or bothersome for advocating for
        ourselves. One of my objectives is to walk with you as you find
        your voice and embrace your strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        I operate from a person-centered lens which allows the client to
        lead sessions at a pace that makes sense for them. We may be a
        strong fit if you are in need of someone to process or explore
        parts of your identity with. Asking for help is a brave step in
        and of itself!

    bio:
      <p>
        Motherhood (and fatherhood!) looks different on everyone. My
        passion for maternal mental health sparked after having my
        daughter and I was able to fully appreciate the challenges and
        range of emotions that surface within parenthood from a lived
        experience. I then sought to specialize in Perinatal Mental Health
        to shift my focus from counseling children to counseling parents.
        When most people hear about Perinatal Mental Health, they often
        think of postpartum depression- but Perinatal Mental Health
        encompasses so much more than that! I work with women in all
        stages of parenthood including infertility, grief, and loss. I am
        here to help you navigate challenges and emotions that may arise
        in pregnancy, birth, and parenthood- including helping you explore
        bonding with your baby, navigating those terrible twos, parenting
        threenagers, and staying true to yourself as a parent through the
        child and adolescent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming a parent often changes your identity, but it should never
        feel like you've lost yourself. Each stage brings new challenges
        and new things to enjoy and it seems as soon as you adjust to one
        stage, a new one is just around the corner! Those of us parenting
        without clear role models of the kind of parent we want to be face
        additional challenges and can benefit greatly from support to make
        their parenting goals and vision a reality. I am here to partner
        with you to maintain your sense of self, your mental health, and
        provide support as we navigate it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as providing support to parents, I want to continue my
        work providing care to children and adolescents. During my five
        years of experience working as a school social worker, I have
        experience providing children with support identifying and naming
        their emotions, positive coping skills, working through
        depression, self harm, and suicidality, and providing crisis
        support. I enjoy working with children going through family
        transitions, parent separation, and social anxiety.

    bio: "
      <p>
        Feeling uncomfortable is a signal that it is time for us to start
        our own process of change. Starting this path of working through
        difficult or emotional challenges sometimes requires deep
        vulnerability. Opening up and being vulnerable with someone else
        can be intimidating, but once practiced, it can also be
        liberating! You may have had things happen to you that were unfair
        and painful, causing conflict within yourself or with others. It
        is especially difficult when you feel alone without someone you
        can talk to, who will listen without judgment. When you feel
        overwhelmed and you are experiencing trials that are difficult to
        navigate, it is time to reach out for support.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey towards becoming a therapist because I know
        that life can be hard and sometimes it feels like a never-ending
        uphill battle. I am here to provide added support during this
        time, to give you the space to be vulnerable, heard, and to share
        tools that can be helpful to you. My goal is to help you feel
        empowered to seek growth, acceptance, and peace within yourself.
        Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and other times you
        might need help learning new coping skills. I hope to be that
        trusted person you can share your thoughts and feelings with, as
        well as practice new skills to be implemented in your everyday
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to being a part of your journey towards
        self-discovery and self-empowerment.

        Many people have had scary or terrible things happen to them;
        trauma isn't just what happens to you - it's how you experience
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe - as is the case with many others - you haven't told anyone.
        Maybe you <em>have</em> told people what happened and their
        response was confusing, hurtful, or dismissive. Maybe you feel
        like you just want it to be over or you should have gotten past it
        already. You might have reminders of what happened impacting your
        life through nightmares, flashbacks, or trying to avoid any
        mention or reminder of the events. You might feel numb. Maybe you
        are a parent and are completely lost on how to help your child
        recover.

      <p>
        I work with adolescents, adults, and families - helping
        individuals that are struggling not only with trauma, but with
