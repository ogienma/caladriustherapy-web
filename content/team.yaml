        You are not fragmented. You are whole- and therapy can help you remember that. Many of us, through trauma, social expectations, or life’s chaos, lose touch with that inner compass. My role is to walk with you as you realign with your authentic self, integrating the emotional, mental, physical, relational, and spiritual parts of who you are.      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about creating a space where you can feel comfortable while navigating the discomfort of growth. I work with individuals experiencing Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, anxiety, depression, attachment wounds, and trauma. My approach draws from trauma-informed Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Attachment Theory, grounded in the belief that you are more than your mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re feeling stuck in patterns that no longer serve you, struggling with anxiety or self-doubt, or sensing there’s more to life than what you’re currently living, I offer a space of depth, compassion, and curiosity. Together, we can explore not just what feels hard, but also what’s possible.

      <p>
        They say social work is a passion, and for me, that couldn’t be more true! Life shapes us in so many ways, and I love exploring the “why” behind the challenges we face. I know starting therapy can feel overwhelming, but that hesitation is completely normal. My goal is to create a safe, supportive space where we can have real conversations and work toward growth—together. So come on in, let’s chat!      </p>
      <p>
        Life is full of challenges, and sometimes they knock us off what we thought was our straight path to success. But that’s the beauty of it—detours often lead us exactly where we need to be. Taking a step back from something or someone doesn’t make you weak; it makes you strong. It takes courage to recognize when something isn’t working and to choose a better route. And sometimes, strength means not just taking the detour but finding the courage to start fresh.

        Challenges in life are inevitable and can hinder how one may take care of him or herself, grow and thrive. Through these challenges, you may become stressed or overwhelmed and seeking solutions on how to overcome these difficulties. Everyon deserves the opportunity to experience joy and to find their true selves. It is my passion to genuinely connect and support you in your journey, so you can find those solutions and get the most from your therapeutic experience.

    bio:
      <p>
        I’m an experienced, passionate, enthusiastic, counselor with over 8 years of counseling experience working with students in Union and Mecklenburg County schools. I am a Charlotte, NC native, but consider Charleston my second home after attending college and meeting my husband there!
      </p>
      <p>
        As your counselor, I am here to support you in creating meaning, finding comfort, and uncovering resources to help you be your best self. I enjoy working with a diverse population of high school-aged teens and young adults. My areas of specialty include anxiety, depression, grief, career struggles, and life transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have an eclectic approach drawing on multiple theoretical orientations and techniques including Solution Focused-Brief Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Person Centered, and Gestalt therapies. During sessions we will use the most effective methods to address your individual needs. I believe that all the answers are within you, and, together, we will create a plan to discover what you need to live a meaningful, healthy and purpose filled life. During sessions some unique approaches we may use include play therapy, mindfulness activities, interactive games and tools, and going outside.      </p>
      <p>
          Outside of the therapy office I enjoy traveling, live music, cooking for others, and running. I have an ambitious goal of running a half marathon in every state (I’ve done 13 already)! For self-care I enjoy sleeping in, treating myself to iced coffee, comfort watching television, and long walks around my neighborhood listening to music and podcasts.      </p>

        It would be my privilege to provide you the space and support to process your experiences,
        thoughts, and feelings so you can move forward in a manner in line with what matters to you.
        My goals are to offer you a context to consider your well-being, to identify the strengths you
        have and the skills you can develop to support your mental health, and to help you gain increased
        insight, self-acceptance, healing, and ability to make desired change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have profound respect for those willing to reach out for support and will meet you with
        empathy, non-judgment, warmth, and encouragement. Currently, my approach is primarily
        informed by strengths-based cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy,
        internal family systems, and EMDR. I invite feedback and strive to create an enviroment and practice that
        is affirming to all and trauma-informed.

        Tackling all that may be thrown your way can be incredibly
        difficult, especially if you take on the challenge alone. My goal
        is to support and hold space for you on that journey. If you are
        experiencing anxiety, grief, or life transitions, I will stand
        beside you as we work to process the impact of those stressors on
        your day to day life. I am here to provide encouragement and space
        to verbalize your frustrations while offering helpful coping
        skills, increased insight, and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am especially passionate about working with women who are
        struggling to protect and maintain their mental health. There are
        times where we feel silenced or bothersome for advocating for
        ourselves. One of my objectives is to walk with you as you find
        your voice and embrace your strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        I operate from a person-centered lens which allows the client to
        lead sessions at a pace that makes sense for them. We may be a
        strong fit if you are in need of someone to process or explore
        parts of your identity with. Asking for help is a brave step in
        and of itself!

    bio:
      <p>
        Motherhood (and fatherhood!) looks different on everyone. My
        passion for maternal mental health sparked after having my
        daughter and I was able to fully appreciate the challenges and
        range of emotions that surface within parenthood from a lived
        experience. I then sought to specialize in Perinatal Mental Health
        to shift my focus from counseling children to counseling parents.
        When most people hear about Perinatal Mental Health, they often
        think of postpartum depression- but Perinatal Mental Health
        encompasses so much more than that! I work with women in all
        stages of parenthood including infertility, grief, and loss. I am
        here to help you navigate challenges and emotions that may arise
        in pregnancy, birth, and parenthood- including helping you explore
        bonding with your baby, navigating those terrible twos, parenting
        threenagers, and staying true to yourself as a parent through the
        child and adolescent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming a parent often changes your identity, but it should never
        feel like you've lost yourself. Each stage brings new challenges
        and new things to enjoy and it seems as soon as you adjust to one
        stage, a new one is just around the corner! Those of us parenting
        without clear role models of the kind of parent we want to be face
        additional challenges and can benefit greatly from support to make
        their parenting goals and vision a reality. I am here to partner
        with you to maintain your sense of self, your mental health, and
        provide support as we navigate it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as providing support to parents, I want to continue my
        work providing care to children and adolescents. During my five
        years of experience working as a school social worker, I have
        experience providing children with support identifying and naming
        their emotions, positive coping skills, working through
        depression, self harm, and suicidality, and providing crisis
        support. I enjoy working with children going through family
        transitions, parent separation, and social anxiety.

  #     <p>
  #       Feeling uncomfortable is a signal that it is time for us to start
  #       our own process of change. Starting this path of working through
  #       difficult or emotional challenges sometimes requires deep
  #       vulnerability. Opening up and being vulnerable with someone else
  #       can be intimidating, but once practiced, it can also be
  #       liberating! You may have had things happen to you that were unfair
  #       and painful, causing conflict within yourself or with others. It
  #       is especially difficult when you feel alone without someone you
  #       can talk to, who will listen without judgment. When you feel
  #       overwhelmed and you are experiencing trials that are difficult to
  #       navigate, it is time to reach out for support.
  #     </p>
  #     <p>
  #       I started my journey towards becoming a therapist because I know
  #       that life can be hard and sometimes it feels like a never-ending
  #       uphill battle. I am here to provide added support during this
  #       time, to give you the space to be vulnerable, heard, and to share
  #       tools that can be helpful to you. My goal is to help you feel
  #       empowered to seek growth, acceptance, and peace within yourself.
  #       Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and other times you
  #       might need help learning new coping skills. I hope to be that
  #       trusted person you can share your thoughts and feelings with, as
  #       well as practice new skills to be implemented in your everyday
  #       life.

      <p>
        Many people have had scary or terrible things happen to them;
        trauma isn't just what happens to you - it's how you experience
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe - as is the case with many others - you haven't told anyone.
        Maybe you <em>have</em> told people what happened and their
        response was confusing, hurtful, or dismissive. Maybe you feel
        like you just want it to be over or you should have gotten past it
        already. You might have reminders of what happened impacting your
        life through nightmares, flashbacks, or trying to avoid any
        mention or reminder of the events. You might feel numb. Maybe you
        are a parent and are completely lost on how to help your child
        recover.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with adolescents, adults, and families - helping
