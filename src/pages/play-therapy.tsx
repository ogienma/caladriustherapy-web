            <h2>Child-Centered Play Therapy</h2>
            <p><strong>More than play. A developmentally appropriate path to healing.</strong></h2>
            <p>Children don't process the world the way adults do. They don't sit on a couch and talk through their feelings. They communicate through play.</p>
            <p>Child-Centered Play Therapy (CCPT) is an evidence-based approach that meets children exactly where they are developmentally, emotionally, and relationally. It uses play as the child's natural language to help them express feelings, process experiences, and build emotional regulation, confidence, and resilience.</p>
            <p>This is not "just playing." It is intentional, structured, and deeply therapeutic.</p>
            
            <h3>What Is Child-Centered Play Therapy for Children?</h3>
            <p>Child-Centered Play Therapy is a non-directive, relationship-based form of therapy where the child leads the play and the therapist follows with attunement, reflection, and emotional safety.</p>
            <p>In the playroom, children are offered a predictable, safe environment with carefully selected toys that allow emotional expression. The therapist is actively engaged, observing patterns, themes, emotional shifts, and relational dynamics while maintaining consistent boundaries that support regulation and trust.</p>
            <p>Through play, children work through experiences they may not yet have words for, including trauma, anxiety, grief, attachment disruptions, behavioral challenges, or major life changes.</p>
            
            <h3>What Child-Centered Play Therapy Is Not</h3>
            <p>Because this is a common concern, it's important to be clear.</p>
            <p>Child-Centered Play Therapy is not babysitting, free-for-all playtime, entertainment, distraction, or the therapist teaching lessons through games or correcting behavior in the moment.</p>
            <p>You may not hear your child clearly explain their problems or see immediate behavioral change. For children, healing often shows up in play first, emotional regulation next, and behavior and language later.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Play Therapy Providers & Training Levels</h3>
            <p>At Caladrius Therapy, we offer multiple levels of play therapy training and approaches, and we welcome families to share their preferences.</p>
            <p>Some of our clinicians are Registered Play Therapists (RPT) or are working toward RPT credentialing under the supervision of a Registered Play Therapist–Supervisor (RPT-S). These therapists have advanced, specialized training in play therapy theory, ethics, and intervention, along with extensive supervised experience focused specifically on children and play-based treatment.</p>
            <p>We also have therapists who are trained in general child-centered play therapy as part of their trauma-informed clinical education. These clinicians use child-centered principles skillfully and ethically, even if they are not pursuing formal RPT credentialing.</p>
            <p>Both pathways are effective and appropriate. The difference reflects depth of specialization, not quality of care. If you have a preference for an RPT/RPT-S–supervised clinician, or a therapist trained in child-centered play therapy or another modality listed below, please let us know when you contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>Blended & Directive Play Therapy Approaches</h3>
            <p>Some children benefit from a fully child-led approach, while others do best with a blended model that integrates child-centered play with therapist-guided, directive interventions. We tailor care based on your child's needs, goals, and developmental stage.</p>
            <p>In blended or directive play therapy, the therapist may intentionally introduce age-appropriate interventions while still honoring the child's autonomy, safety, and nervous system.</p>
            <p>These interventions may include:</p>
            
            <h4>EMDR for Children</h4>
            <p>EMDR can be adapted for children using play-based, visual, and somatic strategies rather than traditional talk therapy. This may involve storytelling, drawing, bilateral movement through games, tapping, or other developmentally appropriate methods to help children process traumatic or overwhelming experiences safely.</p>
            
            <h4>TF-CBT for Children</h4>
            <p>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based treatment designed specifically for children and adolescents who have experienced trauma.</p>
            <p>When used within a play-based or blended approach, TF-CBT may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developmentally appropriate psychoeducation about trauma and emotions</li>
              <li>Skill-building for emotional regulation, coping, and relaxation</li>
              <li>Gradual trauma processing through storytelling, drawing, play, or creative expression</li>
              <li>Caregiver involvement to support healing and strengthen attachment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>TF-CBT is often especially helpful for children who benefit from more structure alongside relational and expressive work.</p>
            
            <h4>Emotional Intelligence & Psychoeducation</h4>
            <p>Children may be gently supported in learning to identify emotions, understand body cues, and build coping skills through games, visuals, stories, and experiential activities matched to their developmental level.</p>
            
            <h4>Social Skills Development</h4>
            <p>Some children need explicit support learning how to navigate peer relationships, group settings, and social expectations in ways that feel safe and authentic.</p>
            <p>When social skills support is clinically appropriate, therapists may use play-based and experiential interventions to help children practice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reading social cues and body language</li>
              <li>Taking turns, sharing space, and negotiating during play</li>
              <li>Managing big emotions in peer interactions</li>
              <li>Building frustration tolerance and flexibility</li>
              <li>Repairing ruptures and rejoining play after conflict</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social skills work is never about forcing compliance or masking a child's personality. Instead, it focuses on helping children understand themselves and others, build confidence, and develop skills that support meaningful connection.</p>
            <p>This work often happens naturally through games, imaginative play, role-play scenarios, and therapist-guided interactions rather than worksheets or drills. We may also have social skills groups available. Caregivers may also be supported with strategies to reinforce these skills at home and in real-world settings.</p>
            
            <h4>Bibliotherapy</h4>
            <p>Therapeutic books are used intentionally to help children explore emotions, experiences, and relational themes. Stories provide distance and safety, allowing children to see themselves reflected without pressure to disclose directly.</p>
            
            <h4>Art Therapy Techniques</h4>
            <p>Drawing, painting, sculpting, and creative expression may be incorporated to help children communicate feelings and experiences that are difficult to put into words. The focus is on the process, not artistic ability.</p>
            
            <h4>Therapeutic Games, Sandtray, and Structured Play</h4>
            <p>Games, sandtray prompts, and guided play activities may be used to support trauma processing, anxiety reduction, emotional regulation, or relational growth when additional structure is clinically indicated.</p>
            <p>A child's therapist will determine whether a non-directive, blended, or more directive approach is the best fit and may shift approaches over time as your child grows and heals.</p>
            
            <h3>What Parents Can Expect</h3>
            <p>Progress often feels subtle at first. Change typically happens internally before it shows up at home or school. Parents may notice improved regulation, fewer or shorter meltdowns, increased confidence, or changes in play and relationships rather than immediate behavioral shifts.</p>
            <p>Your child needs a private emotional space for therapy to work. Therapists will not provide a session-by-session recap, but will share themes, progress, and recommendations without breaking trust.</p>
            <p>Caregiver involvement remains essential. Parent consultations may focus on understanding your child's emotional needs, supporting regulation at home, strengthening attachment, and aligning expectations and boundaries. You may also request Parent Coaching without your child for more directive, structured behavioral support.</p>
            
            <h3>Who Is Play-Based Therapy For?</h3>
            <p>Play-based therapy is often helpful for children experiencing anxiety, trauma, emotional outbursts, grief, family transitions, attachment challenges, or difficulty expressing emotions verbally. It is especially effective for younger children who are not developmentally ready for traditional talk therapy. Typically, for children under 5, we will recommend nondirective child-centered play therapy with tracking, as young children are not developmentally ready to engage in directive work.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Philosophy at Caladrius Therapy</h3>
            <p>We believe children heal through safe relationships, attuned presence, and developmentally appropriate care. Our play therapy services are trauma-informed, evidence-based, and individualized to each child while respecting their pace and voice.</p>
            
            <h3>Is Play Therapy Right for Your Child?</h3>
            <p>If your child is struggling and words aren't working, play may be the bridge.</p>
            <p>We're happy to talk through therapist options, treatment styles, and what approach may best support your child and family. You can reach out to our Clinical Intake Coordinator or use our quiz to schedule a consultation with an available play therapist to learn more.</p>
