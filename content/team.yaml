      <p>
        I work with individuals navigating the complexities of borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, attachment wounds, and the lingering effects of trauma. I hold deep respect for the resilience that comes from lived experience, especially for those who have endured past trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that therapy can be both a vulnerable and empowering journey, so I strive to create a space where all parts of you are welcome. My style is collaborative, warm, and nonjudgmental. I often integrate psychodynamic, trauma-informed, and skills-based approaches to support growth, stability, and a deeper understanding of self.

          Giving up doesn’t mean you are weak; sometimes it means you are strong enough to let it go. - Inglath Cooper

      </p>
      <p>
        They say social work is a passion, and for me, that couldn’t be more true! Life shapes us in so many ways, and I love exploring the “why” behind the challenges we face. I know starting therapy can feel overwhelming, but that hesitation is completely normal. My goal is to create a safe, supportive space where we can have real conversations and work toward growth—together. So come on in, let’s chat!      </p>
      <p>
        Life is full of challenges, and sometimes they knock us off what we thought was our straight path to success. But that’s the beauty of it—detours often lead us exactly where we need to be. Taking a step back from something or someone doesn’t make you weak; it makes you strong. It takes courage to recognize when something isn’t working and to choose a better route. And sometimes, strength means not just taking the detour but finding the courage to start fresh.

        I’m deeply passionate about helping individuals navigate life’s complexities with clarity, ease, and resilience. By embracing holistic wellness principles, I strive to foster a safe and inclusive environment for clients of diverse backgrounds. Within my therapy practice, my primary goal is to cultivate a safe and nurturing environment where clients feel empowered to explore their innermost thoughts and emotions. It’s in this space of comfort and vulnerability that we can go into the core issues, asking and answering the tough questions that lead to meaningful breakthroughs. I firmly believe in collaboration, working hand in hand with clients to navigate this journey of self-discovery and facilitate lasting transformation. Working together, we embark on a profound journey to uncover your truest self, laying the groundwork for genuine and lasting change.

        My beliefs are greatly influenced by the philosophy that all people are capable of change and growth, and deserve to feel joy in this world. My primary theoretical orientation is grounded in the post-modern, Narrative Therapy approach, which examines the rich experiences of my life and the way I share my story with others and reflectively view it myself. In the words of Anderson and Goolishian, "it is my responsibility as a therapist to cultivate a growing awareness of the dominant (and potentially dominating) stories in our society and to develop ways of collaboratively examining the effects of those stories when I sense them at work in the lives and relationships of the people who consult with me."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have used much of my teachings of yoga to ground my work with mindfulness, which is proven to help people live more fully and presently, engaged in connecting with themselves and others. I utilize polyvagal theory and somatic experience when working with clients to regulate their nervous systems and communicate their needs in various environments and relationships. I have found this to be particularly powerful when working in the intersections of trauma, neurodivergence, and gender diversity. I have found a passion in serving folks in the queer community, seeking affirming and safe relationships. I provide support to those looking to embrace their authentic selves and loved ones by writing letters for gender-affirming treatment, attuning to unique needs and experiences, and holding an accepting and non-judgmental space to process pain and pleasure. I also have a passion for working with families to promote understanding and compassion for gender-expansive children and have specialized training in providing child-led gender-affirming play therapy.

       I continue to follow my love for providing mental health care to individuals who seek to learn and embrace themselves and their relationships. I’m working towards a certification in sex therapy, specializing in queer and kink-affirming relationships, relationships with partners who have experienced sexual and incestual trauma, and individuals with medical barriers to sexual fulfillment. I have Level 1 & 2 Gottman Method Couples Therapy training and practice in using Emotion Focused Therapy to empirically support and guide relational work with couples and families who may seek healing, understanding, or pre-commitment work. I am currently participating in an 18-month sex therapy certification program at the Modern Sex Therapy Institute and am a member of the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists. I specialize in working with partners or individuals who struggle with compulsive sexual behaviors, porn addiction, and betrayal trauma.

I enjoy working with a diverse population of high school-aged teens and young adults. My areas of specialty include anxiety, depression, grief, career struggles, and life transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have an eclectic approach drawing on multiple theoretical orientations and techniques including Solution Focused-Brief Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Person Centered, and Gestalt therapies. During sessions we will use the most effective methods to address your individual needs. I believe that all the answers are within you, and, together, we will create a plan to discover what you need to live a meaningful, healthy and purpose filled life. During sessions some unique approaches we may use include play therapy, mindfulness activities, interactive games and tools, and going outside.      </p>
      <p>
          Outside of the therapy office I enjoy traveling, live music, cooking for others, and running. I have an ambitious goal of running a half marathon in every state (I’ve done 13 already)! For self-care I enjoy sleeping in, treating myself to iced coffee, comfort watching television, and long walks around my neighborhood listening to music and podcasts.      </p>

        You may notice that you feel numb or helpless from a broken relationship or a new diagnosis (mental or physical). Or you may feel trapped reliving a traumatic experience. Maybe you recently lost a loved one and are grieving the life that was and could have been. Whatever it is, I’m here to support you on this journey.      </p>

        I aim to meet you where you are and give you the space to flourish. My holistic and strengths-based approach combines wellness practices with trauma-informed modalities to facilitate your healing process. In addition, as a sex positive, LGBTQIA+ affirming, kink/BDSM, and ethical non-monogamous competent therapist, I value providing a safe, confidential, and supportive space for all. In our sessions, I will happily use meditation floor cushions, a weighted blanket, or snacks to create an environment conducive to processing your experiences. My ultimate goal is to guide you from a place of discomfort to a place of healing.      </p>

      <p>
        Starting therapy can feel overwhelming, especially if you’ve learned to stay in your head to feel safe or have spent years minimizing your needs. My hope is to offer a space where you can exhale— where your whole self is welcome, and where healing feels not only possible, but empowering. I specialize in working with adults navigating attachment wounds, anxiety, and overthinking patterns. Many of us carry protective strategies that once helped us survive but now keep us feeling stuck or disconnected. Together, we’ll explore these patterns with curiosity and compassion, gently uncovering the stories they hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is rooted in Internal Family Systems (IFS), Brainspotting, and somatic processing — modalities that honor your body’s wisdom and the many parts of you that have developed over time. I also utilize EMDR, Sandtray therapy, and other trauma-informed approaches to meet your unique needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therapy with me is collaborative and client-led. I’m here to walk alongside you as you navigate the tender and complex work of healing. You are the expert on your experience, and my role is to support you in reconnecting with your inner clarity, strength, and Self. If you're ready to begin, or just curious, I’d be honored to connect.

    bio:
      <p>
        I chose a career in mental health because I understand that humans are hardwired for connection but life can sometimes leave us feeling disconnected. I chose to go into clinical social work to help people through suffering, to help people reconnect with themselves and the people that matter most to them, and to help people make the positive changes they need to live the life that is most fulfilling for them. I am most passionate about helping people make connections about their past experiences/upbringing to increase their self-awareness and cultivate self-compassion for the struggles they are facing in the present moment. Giving people a place to process whatever they need to process, without any fear of judgment, where they feel understood, accepted, valued, and safe. Empowering people to take action to get their wants and needs met in their relationships (romantic, platonic, and familial). I strive to empower and support all clients to make the changes necessary for them to meet their goals through the cultivation of understanding, awareness, and self-compassion. I will meet people where they are, go as fast or as slow as they need to go and focus on the topics/issues they prioritize. I structure therapy sessions to meet the unique needs and preferences of each client because there is no one-size-fits-all. The quality of the therapeutic relationship is of the utmost importance to me, so I check in with my clients on a regular basis to invite feedback and encourage open communication.

    bio:
      <p>
        Motherhood (and fatherhood!) looks different on everyone. My
        passion for maternal mental health sparked after having my
        daughter and I was able to fully appreciate the challenges and
        range of emotions that surface within parenthood from a lived
        experience. I then sought to specialize in Perinatal Mental Health
        to shift my focus from counseling children to counseling parents.
        When most people hear about Perinatal Mental Health, they often
        think of postpartum depression- but Perinatal Mental Health
        encompasses so much more than that! I work with women in all
        stages of parenthood including infertility, grief, and loss. I am
        here to help you navigate challenges and emotions that may arise
        in pregnancy, birth, and parenthood- including helping you explore
        bonding with your baby, navigating those terrible twos, parenting
        threenagers, and staying true to yourself as a parent through the
        child and adolescent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming a parent often changes your identity, but it should never
        feel like you've lost yourself. Each stage brings new challenges
        and new things to enjoy and it seems as soon as you adjust to one
        stage, a new one is just around the corner! Those of us parenting
        without clear role models of the kind of parent we want to be face
        additional challenges and can benefit greatly from support to make
        their parenting goals and vision a reality. I am here to partner
        with you to maintain your sense of self, your mental health, and
        provide support as we navigate it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as providing support to parents, I want to continue my
        work providing care to children and adolescents. During my five
        years of experience working as a school social worker, I have
        experience providing children with support identifying and naming
        their emotions, positive coping skills, working through
        depression, self harm, and suicidality, and providing crisis
        support. I enjoy working with children going through family
        transitions, parent separation, and social anxiety.

      <p>
        Feeling uncomfortable is a signal that it is time for us to start
        our own process of change. Starting this path of working through
        difficult or emotional challenges sometimes requires deep
        vulnerability. Opening up and being vulnerable with someone else
        can be intimidating, but once practiced, it can also be
        liberating! You may have had things happen to you that were unfair
        and painful, causing conflict within yourself or with others. It
        is especially difficult when you feel alone without someone you
        can talk to, who will listen without judgment. When you feel
        overwhelmed and you are experiencing trials that are difficult to
        navigate, it is time to reach out for support.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey towards becoming a therapist because I know
        that life can be hard and sometimes it feels like a never-ending
        uphill battle. I am here to provide added support during this
        time, to give you the space to be vulnerable, heard, and to share
        tools that can be helpful to you. My goal is to help you feel
        empowered to seek growth, acceptance, and peace within yourself.
        Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and other times you
        might need help learning new coping skills. I hope to be that
        trusted person you can share your thoughts and feelings with, as
        well as practice new skills to be implemented in your everyday
        life.
